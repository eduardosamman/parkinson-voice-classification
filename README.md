# parkinson-voice-classification

This script is designed to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. It uses a variety of Python libraries to process and analyze data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

Libraries Used
numpy: Used for numerical operations.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.
sklearn.model_selection: Used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, K-Fold cross-validation, and scoring the cross-validation.
sklearn.preprocessing: Used for preprocessing the dataset, specifically for feature scaling.
sklearn.metrics: Used for evaluating the model, specifically for creating a confusion matrix.
sklearn.decomposition: Used for applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique.
catboost: Used for implementing the CatBoost Classifier, a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees.
imblearn.over_sampling: Used for handling imbalanced classes in the dataset.
How to Run
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the above-mentioned libraries. You can then run the script using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

Please note that this script assumes you have a specific dataset in a specific format. Make sure to adjust the data loading and preprocessing steps according to your dataset.
